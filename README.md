Fraudulent Credit Card Transaction Detection
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions from an imbalanced dataset.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate different machine learning models to accurately classify fraudulent transactions. 
The dataset used in this project is highly imbalanced, with a very small percentage of transactions being fraudulent.

Models Implemented--
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machines (SVM) with advanced kernel functions for the final classification step

Evaluation Metrics--
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves
Learning curves
F1 Score
Confusion Matrix

Results--
The final model, utilizing Support Vector Machines (SVM) with advanced kernel functions, achieved a 96% accuracy on the testing dataset.
This high accuracy demonstrates the model's effectiveness in detecting and mitigating fraudulent transactions.
